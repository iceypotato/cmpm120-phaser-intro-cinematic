## 8 key requirements

3+ Scenes: there are 3+ scenes. I have a scene where you click to play the game, a splash scene, a title screen, and a scene that tells the story.

2+ audio assets: I have recorded my own SFX for the splash, and for the music, I distorted them / bass boosted them using Adobe Premiere. I also extracted 2 of the audio assets directly from the game, and pieced them together.

2+ image assets: I googled some of the images and downloaded them. Then, I change the color and added some objects on the image using Photoshop.

2+ geometric shapes: I used Phaser to add them. I added an ellipse and an isotriangle.

1+ logotype text: the text used for the title screen is a logotype text I used in Photoshop.

1+ multi-line text block: the last scene contains a multiline text box that fades in.

1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black): There is a fading scene transition from the splash screen to the title screen

1+ object motion animation: This is self-evident. You can see it with the text on the title screen.
